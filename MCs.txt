Hi y'all I'm Mack, your new MC editor! MC's are a great way to come out your shell or advertise your club. Really, MC's are what you make them and my job as editor is to make sure everyone feels safe when viewing the MC's. Please do not test me. If I receive anything outta pocket (i.e. anything that reminds me of the problematic feeds on 4chan) I'm not posting it :) My email is mmarsaw@reed.edu and feel free to ask me questions! Say what you need to say but be mindful of what you say. Have at it babes!
HERE IS THE FORM TO SUBMIT TO MCS!!!!!


MCs
coming to ur inbox soon.....


1. 

Looking for a new home/buyer of my very first harness. This harness is in great condition I just never wear it anymore because I don't wear gold. Ms harness deserves to worn more often. 


Gold hardware with black leather. I don't know the size but you're welcome to try it on first. Detachable tassels and very comfy. 


I thought about selling it online but it would be really cool to know the person who ends up with such a special piece. Feel free to email me with any questions! I will add one more mc with what it looks like on. 


Price negotiable starting at $65 
  



   2.   Harness part 2
MC Editor: Serving mad cunt, are we?


      3. You: planned a date for us and took me out. It was the loveliest night I had, and the first time someone had planned a date for me.
You: said you weren't ready to date but wanna be friends
I: think ur rlly rad and wanna be friends
We: should hang out sometime and walk around the canyon!! :^) perhaps find a raccoon?


      4. you: live above me 
you: like to stomp around and drop heavy items repeatedly 
my roommate: confronted you
you: claimed ignorance
i: don't believe you
why: are you moving furniture at 4am
maybe: you don't realize how loud you are??
either way: please stop
it is: so distracting
thank: you


      5. @MC44: I would love to go see the nutcracker!!! Txt me! 541-956-3186

      7. you: don’t live here
neither: do the people you keep bringing up here
no: one gets along with them
please: respect peoples boundaries and stop bringing people here who are rude to people that live here
MC Editor: I truly believe if you just confronted them head-on you’d be better off cuz I guarantee you all this person will do is bitch in the MCs and complain to ppl, don’t be a pussy cuz I’m sure they’ll be one.


      8. you: author of mc 32

      9. You: get the fuck off my floor.
I'm: begging you.
Please: leave.
You: said that you feel like you're unwelcome here.
You: were right.
So why: the fuck are you still here?
I: have been thinking. Maybe others don't want you you on their floor either.
Valid
Please: recognize that other people do not appreciate your noisiness, intoxication, and ignorance. 
MC Editor: Please see MC 7 for ways to handle obnoxious ppl....it’s not confrontation everyone, it’s communication and setting boundaries face to face.


      10. @MC 73
Small dogs: do sometimes behave like devil spawn
but: I wish we would stop blaming the dog for its circumstances
imagine: having brachycephaly, spinal deformities, patellar luxation, and developing chronic pneumonia by age 2
there is: a point in a little dog's life where they get sick of being picked up, squeezed, and having their space invaded over and over again
everyone: be respectful to your dogs
and: stop buying Frenchies, pugs and Cavaliers

      31. dear: MC editor, Mac
I: really like ur silly little notes 
I: don’t think u overstep ur powers by adding them now and again 
u: are funny 
on: a more serious note
I: think the latent argument of academia that any objective voice can be attained in any perspective, especially but not only academic, is inherently flawed and harmful and our only way of experiencing the world is through our subjective and unique selves and thus
I: appreciate your intermittent insertion of your voice into the conversation you facilitate here
I: could have emailed u directly but 
I: luv to make reedies read my silly little anti-academia takes >:)

      48. Reedies:
  



      49. Why is Reed so cliquey and judgemental? Does it stay like this? Is Freshman year worse than usual? Do cliques die down later on? I feel everyone who didn’t find a group within the first two or three weeks is destined to lack friendships.


      50. ME: i keep going back and forth on whether I’m asexual,  i feel asexual for months, completely no sexual attraction to anyone then randomly I’ll meet someone and in two or three hours, I’m have “a woahhhh that’s not an asexual feeling towards you” moment, last time it happened it was back before the year started, then randomly a couple weeks ago with a person I’ll probably never talk to much again, I once again went through a “nope nope not asexual” moment, do most people only feel attraction like four or five times a year? And not even with people you trust or connect with or like intellectually (thought i was demi for a while) but just completely randomly? to the person who helped me remember i can in fact feel attraction… hope you’re okay, you made me question my sexuality once again on my monthly pipeline of maybe I’m a lesbian with comphet to the huh have i felt actual romantic or sexual attraction EVER to  (after meeting you) huh back to pansexual?

      79. I love all the corny, flustered MCs about crushes and stuff.  They make me feel like love is in the air on campus.  <3  Keep living your exquisite emotional dramas! 


But also.  Y'all should be blunt and open with each other.  Even if that someone doesn't like you back, they can at least be flattered that they matter to you.


      80. You: are a musician who is interested in making a music video
I: Am getting into experimental and conventional filmmaking and would love to make one with you

      82. hello
this: is my favorite hat
my head: can be a strange and unruly place
and more importantly: is frequently cold
this hat: gives my silly head shelter from the physical
and: metaphysical slings and arrows of existence
it: is also missing as of december 5th
and: nothing good has happened since
this: is not a coincidence
please: if you have seen this hat
or: know even an iota or inkling of its whereabouts
and: you let me know
i: will do anything
buy: you a coffee
give you: the hug of a lifetime
and: a firm hand shake


the best guess i can give to its whereabouts are:
the library
the side of elliot hall by the blue bridge
specifically near that lovely little creepy alcove thing under the stairs
commons
the commons bathroom
the pool hall
the red/slightly more unhinged pool hall bathroom
near the fish-ladder and adjoining path
the path through the canyon walking towards greenwood
the bench and stones near the man-made pond & waterfall on said path
trillium? but probably not


this mc: is so far from anonymous
you: can even see what i look like in the attached photo
of: me wearing the hat in question
i: am very conspicuous
and: am 6'2
please: if you know anything about my hat
ask for: my email
or literally: approach me
i would also: love to have a conversation with you about something you love
as i: consider myself pretty approachable
and: really enjoy when people ramble about their passions


anyways: there is a little tag inside that says military beret
and: a small black bow in the back
she is: a beautiful little hat
and we: have been yearning for one another across time and space
thank you: for reading
and: letting me know
if you: have seen it

87.        too scared to say this directly to y’all but some of y’all in my vague non specific eastern european language course need to chill. love y’all to death but enough of the prof obsession. i don’t want this to be hostile or anything but y’all need to chilllllllll out. it’s a touch obsessive. keep being you for the most part. 


88.        .It’s sad here where the wind meets the dandelions
who are tucked behind hair and sky and sun
Who whispers and whimpers
and cry of lilac 
But who can judge? 
The warm perfections 
lay in the glow of the afternoon 
And vibrant into the evening 


89.        me: has large swiss cheese plant
